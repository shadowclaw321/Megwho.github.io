    <td>This lesson was a cover lesson. I found that concentration when my friends were trying to talk to me was key. I eventually found this useful and went on to complete half of the ninth badge too. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to do more work in the lesson because most of it I did at home and sure it helped me but lessons are the main purpose for learning so I need to make better use of the lesson time and do more work in the actual lesson. This will make my workload easier and I will have more time to do my blogs. This is the only thing that I think I need to work on.</td>

    <td>I will do more work in lessons, practise on my concentration skills and use my learning time wisely. These will guarantee success in my  future in codecademy. This week has been my most improved learning lesson in the whole of the year in I.T.</td>
