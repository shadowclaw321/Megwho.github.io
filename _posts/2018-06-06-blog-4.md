    <td>Pyglatin for me is one of the hardest topics to cover in Python. I felt like I did not understand it that much. I eventually got round to understanding it but it was quite a pain. In code academy I had to make a pyglatin generator which I found was the hardest thing to do in the topic of pyglatin I had to keep using hints.

    <td>I think I need to go home and do some of the exercise at home because It takes quite a long time to do in lessons and I don't think I will get my badge in the next lesson. So I need to get on youtube, practise using it and try to get myself in situations where I don’t know what to do but use my knowledge to overcome it.</td>
