    <td>I was very concentrated on my task even though we had no work to do. I started a bit on python but not much. Most of the lesson was me setting up my website because i was struggling with it quite a bit. In the end I finished it home but it still needs a lot more code.
I was a bit confused on the process of forking but I understood it in the end.</td>
